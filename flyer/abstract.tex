{\sffamily\Large\bfseries What will you learn in this class?}

You will learn how to write programs that run fast and use computers
efficiently.

\textbf{Pop Quiz:} \$400 at your favorite electronics retailer
buys you a parallel computer that will do
$4\cdot 10^{12}$ floating point operations (``flops'') per second,
but only load $5\cdot 10^{10}$ values from memory in the same
amount of time. How do you use such a machine well?

What to expect:
\vspace{-0.5em}
\begin{itemize}

  \item Basic processor architecture\\
    Performance of sequential code
  \item Why go parallel? Forms of parallelism
  \item Shared Memory and \textbf{OpenMP}
  \item Tools and Debuggers
  \item \textbf{GPUs} and \textbf{OpenCL}
  \item Distributed Memory and \textbf{MPI}
  \item Common Patterns in Parallel Algorithms
\end{itemize}
